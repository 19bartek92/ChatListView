# ChatListView

After a long span of product management and entrepreunrship I decided to dust off my programming skills.  It had been about 26 years since i wrote any real amount of code.  I found myself working on yet another chat app and decided to use Xamarin Forms.  I wanted to make the user experience 100% native but keep as much of the code in XF.  Countless examples referenced in the Xamarin forums and some wonderful blogs answered most of my questions.  One topic seemed rather allusive; proper text input on a chat window for iOS.
